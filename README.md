<h1>Domain User Account Creation</h1>

<h3>&#9312; Execute PowerShell script</h3>
<p>We will use a PowerShell script to create domain user accounts in our Active Directory Domain. 
</p>

- Login to VM1-DC with the credentials of S-Samuels or any admin user
- Open PowerShell as an administrator, copy and paste the script provided here, <a href="https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1"> script </a>, and run it.

   - <p><strong>Learn more about the Powershell script here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsI8hJmggI&t=1623s">User Generation script </a> </strong></p> 

<br>
<br>

- Once the script finishes running you can verify the newly created user accounts in the Active Directory Users and Computers

<p><strong>NOTE: Just for this tutorial, make sure the password policy is changed inside the Group Policy Objects of the domain, to allow us to create user accounts without password restrictions</strong></p>

<h3>&#9313; Login as domain user </h3>

- Letâ€™s log in as a domain user to verify the previous task's success.
- Please remember to note the password used in our script (USERPASSWORD).

  This user should be able to log in since it's one of the generated user accounts

<h2> Conclusion </h2>

<p>In conclusion, the "Active Directory Domain User Generation" project optimizes our user management process. By utilizing a PowerShell script, we can efficiently create domain user accounts.</p>
